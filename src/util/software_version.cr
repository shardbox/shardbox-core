# The `Version` type represents a version number.
#
# An instance can be created from a version string which consists of a series of
# segments separated by periods. Each segment contains one ore more alpanumerical
# ASCII characters. The first segment is expected to contain only digits.
#
# There may be one instance of a dash (`-`) which denotes the version as a
# pre-release. It is otherwise equivalent to a period
#
# This format is described by the regular expression:
# `/[0-9]+(?>\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+)*(-[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?/`
#
# This implementation is compatible to popular versioning schemes such as
# [`SemVer`](https://semver.org/) and [`CalVer`](https://calver.org/) but
# doesn't enforce any particular one.
#
# It behaves mostly equivalent to [`Gem::Version`](http://docs.seattlerb.org/rubygems/Gem/Version.html) from `rubygems`.
#
# ## Sort order
# This wrapper type is mostly important for properly sorting version numbers,
# because generic lexical sorting doesn't work: For instance, `3.10` is supposed
# to be greater than `3.2`.
#
# Every set of consecutive digits anywhere in the string are interpreted as a
# decimal number and numerically sorted. Letters are lexically sorted.
# Periods (and dash) delimit numbers but don't effect sort order by themselves.
# Thus `1.0a` is equal to `1.0.a`.
#
# ## Pre-release
# If a version number contains a letter (`a-z`) then that version is considered
# a pre-release. Pre-releases sort lower than the rest of the version prior to
# the first letter (or dash). For instance `1.0-b` compares lower than `1.0` but
# greater than `1.0-a`.
